Bad Machinery Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to my other favorite web comics and even some mangas, so I've now expanded it to [Bad Machinery](http://www.scarygoround.com/).

Each chapter is loaded into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).


How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for one of my favorite webcomics.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getBadMachinery.rb`
  - Answers the prompts accordingly
  - Enjoy all of Bad Machinery!
